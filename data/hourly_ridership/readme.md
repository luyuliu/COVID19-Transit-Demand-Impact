# Request hourly ridership
Hourly ridership data is a third-party data that we cannot upload directly. According to [PLOS ONE's third-party data sharing policy](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-third-party-data), we share the method here. We requested the hourly ridership by submitting the [Transit COVID-19 data request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2s1qO1_xNJbxbDwopODgdgl1kR1BBho61AEiC4Yo1e5u6hg/viewform). You should fill in the form and the Transit app will contact you.
